# Mr. B. Remembers 
## Goal of the project 
A good friend of mine has a short term memory disorder but he is fortunate enough to visit a lot of beautifull places. 
So selfishly I want to help him remember where he went so I can enjoy it too. 

## Step 1 Learn to work with Map data 
## Step 2 Use the google API  
## Step 3 Use a microcontroller to interact with the google api through a button press
## Step 4 Build prototype
